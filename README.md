# Project Description
A d3 generated force-directed graph of any given user's artists, linked by common tags

now with spotify integration!

MusicStats was created with the purpose of providing alternative information about your listening preferences in an objective manner. By visualizing your favorite artists, you are able to see how consistent your taste in genres is, and what artists resonate closest with those genres.
